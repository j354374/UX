        <h2>Bio</h2>
       <p>Greg Luxemburg had very high expectations from my parents growing up. His father wanted him to study medicine and his mother wanted him to study law. He tried to keep them both happy but ended up cracking under the pressure. He bombed out on his TEE exams and only got into a Health, fitness and Leisure course at Edith Cowan University. His father was angry and called it a "Micky mouse course" and that he would never look him in the eye again. It was just as well the uni offered student accomdation and he was kicked out of home.</p>

<p>Greg studdied hard, wanting to show his parents that he could complete something and win back their love. While juggling his studies with working grueling hours at a local pizzeria Greg buckled down and finished his course. Sadly Gregs parents ignored his letters and calls. He went to the family home and knocked on the door. His parents were entertaining people from a high social status and didn't want them to see him. Greg left heart broken. He had tried so hard to win their love and approval but nothing he could do was ever good enough. </p>

<p>Greg found comfort and support amongst the friends he had made at ECU. He still continued working at the Pizzeria where he was treated like the family he always wanted. One day though the landlord increased the rent so much that the business could not continue operating. Greg tried to talk some sense into the landlord but saw that his eyes were glazed with greed and the sickness of the Wendigo.</p>
  
<p>Luckily Greg had his Bsc Health, Fitness and Leisure and with the help of a friend of ECU was able to get a job working at the counter in a gym. From there he started running  fitness clases and even gained some clients of his own.  </p>
<p>Greg no longer works on the counter. He trains people and writes nutrition plans for them. The greatest joy for Greg is being able to transform someone and turn their life around.
He improves the quality of their life for people and he turns no one away. Greg has a great deal of compassion which is credits to his support network from ECU. There he found healing friendships full of nuturing, openless, empathy and shared joy.
